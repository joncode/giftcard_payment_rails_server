Expiration Cron

	Every day at 	14:30 UTC
					10:30 EDT
					 9:30 EST
					 7:30 PDT
					 6:30 PST

	EDT is 4 hours behind UTC - summer
	PDT is 7 hours behind UTC - summer

	EST is 5 hours behind UTC - winter
	PST is 8 hours behind UTC - winter

	--- these are the bug points for dates - situations where the server date calculation is one day later

		EDT - after 8 pm utc is next day
		PDT - after 5 pm utc is next day
		EST - after 7 pm utc is next day
		PST - after 4 pm utc is next day

Expiration time in the method is

	date = Time.now.utc.to_date

	Time.now     		 = 2014-06-12 14:30:07 +0000
	Time.now.utc 		 = 2014-06-12 14:30:30 UTC
	Time.now.utc.to_date = Thu, 12 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000

Comparison is

	Time.now.utc.to_date > gift.expires_at.to_date

	If June 12th > June 12th then expire


Issue #1 - expiration date should be in the timezone of the merchant

	example - Vegas merchant wants to give away a gift that expires on june 16th , that means the gift is NO longer good on the 16th
	so they choose an expiration date of 6/16
		which in datetime is really
			after
				end of business day on the 15th = 6/16 @ 4:00 -8000
				utc = 6/16 noon
				before the 6/16 cron
			before
				beginning of biz day on the 16th = 6/16 @ 10:00 -8000
				utc = 6/6 18:00
				after the 6/16 cron
				gift will expires at
				end of business day on 6/16
